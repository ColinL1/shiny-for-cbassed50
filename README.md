<!-- ## Overview

R package to process CBASS-derived PAM data. Minimal requirements are PAM data (or data from any other continuous variable that changes with temperature, e.g. relative bleaching scores) from 4 samples (e.g., nubbins) subjected to 4 temperature profiles of at least 2 colonies from 1 coral species from 1 site. Please refer to the [CBASS method paper](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10555) for in-depth information regarding CBASS acute thermal stress assays, ED50 thermal thresholds, etc.
